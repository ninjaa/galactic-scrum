# Galactic Scrum - Game Development Plan

## Game Concept
**Galactic Scrum** is a single-player casual rugby x space opera game targeting casual gamers.

### Pitch
It's halftime for humanity. The mighty alien empire, The Zorgonauts, have challenged Earth to an intergalactic rugby showdown. With the fate of the planet on the line, our pint-sized hero straps on his cosmic cleats to tackle, leap, blast, and scrum his way across galaxies. It's retro-gaming glory meets Saturday-morning-cartoon mayhem!

### Main Character
**ðŸŒŸ Ruck Ryder**
- **Alter Ego**: Ryder Keen
- **Age**: 8 Earth-years
- **Home Base**: Backyard Clubhouse, Springfield
- **Role**: Playable protagonist

**Description**: Rambunctious Ryder Ruckstonâ€”known to everyone as "Ruck"â€”is a third-grade rugby enthusiast with unmatched bravery, a wild imagination, and gravity-defying hair. Armed with his trusty Photon Punt-Blasterâ„¢ (a rugby ball-launching ray gun that freezes aliens on impact) and his signature Gravity Boots (jump higher, run faster, dodge mean tackles), Ruck is Earth's only hope to win the Rugby Galactic Cup. His boundless optimism and smart-aleck remarks hide the heart of a champion determined to "ruck and roll."

**Catchphrase**: "Scrum and get some!"

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Core Rugby Elements
- Running with the ball
- Passing/kicking the ball
- Tackling/avoiding alien defenders
- Scoring tries in designated zones
- Scrums, rucks, and mauls reimagined in space context

### Space Opera Elements
- Gravity manipulation (jumping higher in low-G areas)
- Photon Punt-Blaster freezing opponents
- Spectacular cosmic environments
- Power-ups with space themes
- Warp zones between different areas of the level

### Level Design (First Level: Kansas Crop Circles)
- Maze-like crop circle patterns forming the rugby field
- Hidden bonus areas in certain crop circles
- Zorgonaut defenders patrolling paths
- Goal zones at the end of complex patterns
- Environmental obstacles (tractors, scarecrows, alien ships)

## Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack

#### 3D Engine: Three.js
Three.js is recommended for this project because:
- It's a lightweight, powerful 3D library that works directly in the browser
- Has excellent documentation and a large community
- Provides sufficient capabilities for a casual game without excessive complexity
- Easy integration with other web technologies
- Good performance on modern browsers

#### Physics Engine Options

**Recommended: Cannon.js**
- Lightweight physics engine that integrates well with Three.js
- Good for casual games with moderate physics requirements
- Simpler API compared to alternatives
- Sufficient for character movement, ball physics, and basic collisions

**Alternative: Ammo.js**
- More robust physics simulation
- Better suited if we need more complex physics interactions
- Higher performance ceiling but steeper learning curve
- Requires more optimization for web performance

#### Supporting Libraries
- **TweenJS**: For smooth animations and transitions
- **Howler.js**: For audio management
- **Stats.js**: For performance monitoring during development

### Build Tools and Project Structure

#### Build System: Vite
Vite is recommended because:
- Extremely fast development server with hot module replacement
- Simple configuration
- Modern ES module support
- Built-in TypeScript support
- Easy production builds
- Minimal configuration required
